As part of a class project, I created a 2D design of a rigid bar confined within a space of 150cm long and 50cm tall.

<div style="text-align:center; margin: 2em 0;">
	<img src="/assets/images/my2Ddesign.png" alt="2D Design" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;" />
</div>
