My name is Sam Smiley, and I am a Mechanical Engineer at Cornell University. I am an AFROTC Cadet at Detachment 520 and am an active member of SOCOM Ignite, where are current project is detecting fiber optic drones. As treasurer in the Cornell Special Warfare Club, I also participate and coordinate weekly rucks and water confidence focused swim sessions. My passions include competitive powerlifting, long distance running, and cycling. I used to work for Trek Bikes and sold nearly half a million dollars worth of bicycles and also assisted the local bike COOP and refurbished bikes for those in need.
